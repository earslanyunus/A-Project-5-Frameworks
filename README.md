# A-Project-5-Frameworks

Hi, I'm Yunus and I'm a junior developer. I've decided to start this project, but why? Because I want to learn the difference between frameworks. I've chosen 5 popular frameworks which are **React, Vue, Svelte, Qwik and Solid**. I will develop the same project using different frameworks. I will write details and differences between the frameworks as I develop the project.

My goal of this project is to clearly understand the main purpose of these frameworks and the differences between them .
