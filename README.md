# Project Description
Hi, I'm Yunus and I'm a junior developer. I've decided to start this project, but why? Because I want to learn the difference between frameworks. I've chosen 5 popular frameworks which are **React, Vue, Svelte, Qwik and Solid**. I will develop the same project using different frameworks. I will write details and differences between the frameworks as I develop the project.

My goal of this project is to clearly understand the main purpose of these frameworks and the differences between them .

## My experience and thoughts

As I embarked on this project, I experienced firsthand the differences in syntax and methods of handling events (like fetch, reactive values, etc.) across various JavaScript frameworks. In this article, I won't be discussing which is better, as all these frameworks essentially serve the same purpose. What varies is the syntax and the approaches to handling different scenarios. While some require extensive effort for optimization, others have this aspect already taken care of. Hence, there's no need to be partisan towards any particular framework; they are all libraries or frameworks developed for us. Depending on project requirements or personal comfort, you can choose the one that suits you best. It's important to focus on a framework that allows you to create a comfortable working space for yourself, rather than constantly switching between different ones.

For instance, in this project, I often found myself opening the browser to check things like if-else conditions, looping through data with for loops, or performing fetch operations. This was mainly because I wasn't as familiar with the intricacies of these frameworks as I am with JSX and React, where such frequent checks aren't necessary, allowing for faster project development. Therefore, it's beneficial to have a framework you're an expert in and know well, while also keeping an eye on the developments of other frameworks.

One framework that stood out in this project was Solid.js. Its approach to handling fetch operations and its reactive data system made it easier to work with compared to React. I'm already looking forward to using Solid.js in my future projects. A note on Angular: recent data shows a declining trend in its usage. However, it seems that the Angular team is aware of this and is in the process of revamping Angular, sending a message of a strong comeback. I'm eager to experience the renewed version once it's stable. While I've mentioned five frameworks in this project, there's always a possibility of exploring and adding more worthwhile frameworks for comparison in the future.

**Update-1**

I have decided not to use the Qwik framework in this project because it lacks a library capable of routing, similar to react-router or vue-router. Instead, I will be integrating Angular into the project.
